# Titanic Dataset Analysis and Survival Prediction

This repository contains code for analyzing the Titanic dataset and building machine learning models to predict passenger survival. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset widely used for data analysis and machine learning tasks. It provides information about passengers on the Titanic, including their age, sex, class, fare, and survival status.

## Dataset Selection
The Titanic dataset is chosen for analysis because of its popularity and the valuable insights it offers about the passengers. It serves as an excellent dataset for practicing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and implementing machine learning algorithms.

## Instructions for Running the Code

To run the code and perform the analysis, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required Python packages installed. If not, you can install them using the following command:
```bash
pip install rpy2 pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
3. Download the Titanic dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and save it as "titanic.csv" in the "Python_Assignment10" folder (the repository's root directory).
4. Open the "Assignment10.py" file in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.
5. Execute the code in your Python environment. The code will read the dataset, preprocess the data, implement two machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier), and display the accuracy and confusion matrix for each model.
6. After executing the code, you will see a heatmap visualization representing the correlation between features in the dataset.

Note: Ensure that you have both R and Python environments set up correctly. The code uses the "rpy2" package to interact with R for some operations. If you encounter any issues related to the R environment setup or R packages, please refer to the relevant documentation.
